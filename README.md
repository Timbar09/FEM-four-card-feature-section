## Overview

This is the second challenge from Frontend Mentor that i have completed. It was a bit more difficult than the last one but I took less time to complete it than I initially anticipated.

### The challenge

The site is responsive and viewers can view the optimal layout of the site accross multiple screen sizes such as mobiles phones, tablets and destktops.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS3 extension

### What I learned

I have learned to use Github (Desktop version) for thje very first time with this challenge. I have also learned that I can insert SVG code of an image directly into the html markup as opposed to linking the image to html with css as well as interchanging flexbox and grid for the same elements within different viewports.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

  @include breakpoint-up(large) {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, auto);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(4, auto);
  }
}
```
### Continued development

I want to continue using Github as it is relatively new to me and I am beggining to see the benefits of it in my coding development. I would also like to use javaScript and javaScript frameworks such as React in future challenges in oder to add to my skills.
